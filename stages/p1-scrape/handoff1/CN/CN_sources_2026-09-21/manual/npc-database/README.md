# 国家法律法规数据库 · flk.npc.gov.cn — layer 1

## Start here: the whole section, not only our list

**Collect every relevant instrument in these sections**, not only the documents listed further down. The
list below is what we already know is there; use it afterwards to check nothing was missed. A curated list
records what we already knew, and on CAC it missed 42 of 68 tier-2 documents.

| Section | Address | How the address is known |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 国家法律法规数据库 | https://flk.npc.gov.cn/ | the database itself |

**What counts as relevant.** Anything touching data, cybersecurity, telecom, the internet, e-commerce,
payments, digital trade, foreign investment in those sectors, ICT goods, or standards for them. Skip what
plainly is not — energy pricing, agriculture, construction, internal administration. If unsure, take it:
a document collected and not needed costs a line in the sheet; a document needed and missed costs an
indicator. Add each one to `provenance.tsv` as a new row.

These hosts refuse our client, so none of these addresses could be opened by the tool. Where one has moved,
navigate from the site's 政策法规 or 政务公开 menu, and note the new address in `notes`.

**MANUAL — you download these, in a browser.**

Why not automatic:

- `flk.npc.gov.cn` — robots.txt forbids automated collection

## How to fill this folder

1. Open each link in `provenance.tsv`.
2. Save the file **into `raw/`** — never beside this README. `raw/` is kept out of git by `.gitignore`;
   anything saved elsewhere in this folder would be committed.
3. **If the page has an attachment (附件, `.doc`, `.pdf`), save the attachment too.** On these sites the
   law is often *in* the attachment and the page is only a wrapper — the MIIT telecom catalogue page carries
   572 characters; its `.doc` carries the whole classification.
4. Fill in four columns: `file_saved_as`, `fetched_on`, **`version_date_on_document`** (the 施行 or 修订 date
   printed on the document itself, not today's date), and `notes`.

## Documents to collect: 0

Layer 1 is the **whole database, downloaded in bulk** (about 10 minutes). One provenance record for the
export is enough — source, date, what it contained — not one line per law. Only the ~25 instruments
that are actually cited need their version date read off the document; they are listed in
`outputs/CN/CN_corpus_plan.md`, layer 1.
